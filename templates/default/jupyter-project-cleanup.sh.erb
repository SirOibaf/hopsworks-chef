# This script allows Hopsworks to cleanup local directories for Jupyter Notebook Servers.
# There will be 1 notebook-server per ProjectUser.
# This script can be run by hopsworks (running as user 'glassfish') as a sudo command as 'root'
# The script should run as 'root' as the jupyter user does not have read privileges on the base directory for a user's
# project and cannot do a recursive delete on the directory.
